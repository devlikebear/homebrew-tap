  caveats <<~EOS
    TARS.app includes the tars server and the tars command; nothing else
    needs installing.

    If the formula devlikebear/tap/tars is installed, it keeps the tars
    command on PATH (the app still runs its own server). To use the app's:
      brew uninstall devlikebear/tap/tars
      brew reinstall --cask devlikebear/tap/tars-desktop
