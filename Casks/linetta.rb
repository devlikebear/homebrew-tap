  caveats <<~EOS
    Linetta is ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so macOS Gatekeeper may block
    it on first launch. To allow it to run, clear the quarantine attribute:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Linetta.app"

    Or install without quarantine in the first place:

      brew install --cask --no-quarantine linetta
  EOS
